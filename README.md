# -TASK-1

This is my first task assigned by my intructor of internship.
<b>Inside this task I had performed the implementation for Data Cleaning and Preprocessing on a raw data</b>
Dataset used =[text](netflix_titles.csv)

This dataset contains lots of information regarding Netflix and T.V shows
I had manipulate data and had performed some changement with the help of PANDAS tools of PYTHON
<b>Some highlighted changes:-</b>
1.) Identifying and handle missing values using "df.isnull(),fillna()"
2.) Removing duplicate rows using "df.drop_duplicates() ,df.duplicated()"
3.) Standardize text values like country names, etc. "df.str.upper()"
4.) Convert date formats to a consistent type (like: dd-mm-yyyy).
5.) Clean column names: uppercase, remove spaces
6.) Check and fix data types (e.g., age should be int, date as datetime) using "astype()" methods
